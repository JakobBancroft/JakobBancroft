- 👋 Hi, I’m @JakobBancroft
- 👀 I’m interested in mechanics, nature, and working with my hands.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mechanical engineering, and going for my four year degree.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as I am not very good with coding and computer science. My main goal in this class is to learn as much as possible. 
- 📫 How to reach me is usually my school email, jakobbancroft@student.olympic.edu, or you can message me through Canvas.
